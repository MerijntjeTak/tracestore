#    tracestore.pl - Store traceroutes based on NetFlow data
#
#   This scripts processes a flowd database file, gets a list of all hosts 
#    contacted, does a traceroute to them and stores the result in a database.
#    This data can later be analyzed to, for example, map your ISP's AS 
#    paths.
#
#    Usage:
#     1. Start flowd and let it collect flows (see flowd man page)
#     1. Configure the variables in the script
#     2. Run the script
#
#    Dependencies:
#     - Perl module DBD::mysql
#     - Perl module Net::Traceroute
#     - flowd (tested with version 0.9.1, www.mindrot.org/projects/flowd/)
#
#    Database:
#    The script is designed to use a MySQL database backend. An example table
#     structure is provided in the mysql-tracestore.sql file. The file can be
#     loaded like this:
#     1. Login to MySQL
#       $ mysql -u root -p
#     2. Create a database
#       mysql> create database tracestore;
#     3. Create a new user
#       mysql> grant all on tracestore.* to 'username'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
#     4. Load the table structures
#       $ mysql -u username -p tracestore < mysql-tracestore.sql
#
#    Variables used in the script:
#     mysqlHost - Database server hostname
#     mysqlUser - Database username
#     mysqlPass - Database password
#     mysqlName - Database name
#
#     flowdFile - flowd database file to be used by the flowd-reader process
#
#     flowdSudo - Boolean to indicate whether sudo should be used to run the flowd-reader
#
#     flowdBin - Path to flowd-reader binary
#
#     sudoBin - Path to sudo binary
#
#     processTime - Number of seconds the script has to look back in the flowd database
#                    for flows to trace. If you put the script in cron, and let it run every
#                    5 minutes, set this variable to 300.
